        <h3>API Used: Open Weather Map API</h3>
            <p>Open Weather Map takes in a location as a string and outputs the current temperature </br> and weather of that location.</p>
            <p>Found on: https://openweathermap.org/api </p>
        <h3>Options Used</h3>
             <p>The options I used for this API were the temperature, and the exact type of weather </br> currently. The weather returns and ID which corresponds to a specific weather pattern </br>such as rain, snow, or scattered clouds.</p>
        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
             <p>Weather is useful for a veriety of different sites. It can be used for a hotel site to </br> persuade people to book during sunny days or for other applications </br> such as on a hiking website so you know when the best time to hike is. </p>
